    <p>This hearty Chilean stew of beef, corn, and pumpkin is a one dish meal. The main ingredients are stewed in serving-sized pieces, so that each person receives a large piece surrounded by a broth with the other vegetables. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds beef roast </li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) carton beef broth </li>
        <li>2 cups water </li>
        <li>¼ cup polenta (coarse or fine) </li>
        <li>8 red potatoes, cut in half </li>
        <li>1 onion, quartered </li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds slice of pumpkin</li>
        <li>2 ears corn, cut into thirds </li>
        <li>1 carrot, cut into 1/2 inch slices </li>
        <li>1 small red bell pepper, seeded and cut into 1 inch pieces </li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, cut into chunks </li>
        <li>1 leek, split in half, then cut into 1/2-inch pieces </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon mild paprika </li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves (lightly packed) </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the piece of beef into 6 large chunks (one per serving). Place the beef into a large saucepan; pour in the beef broth and water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium, cover, and simmer until nearly tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Stir the polenta into the stew along with the potatoes and onion. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Cut the pumpkin into 6, serving-sized pieces, and add to the stew along with the corn, carrot, bell pepper, celery, and leek; simmer until the vegetables are tender, adding more water if needed to barely cover. Stir in the oregano and paprika during the last 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper. Ladle into serving bowls, and sprinkle with chopped cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
